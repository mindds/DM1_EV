Alignment pipline
A Snakemake workflow is defined by specifying rules in a Snakefile. Rules decompose the workflow into small steps (for example, the application of a single tool) by specifying how to create sets of output files from sets of input files. Snakemake automatically determines the dependencies between the rules by matching file names.
